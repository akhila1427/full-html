HTML is a markup language used by the browser to manipulate text, images, and other content, in order to display it in the required format. HTML was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991. The first-ever version of HTML was HTML 1.0, but the first standard version was HTML 2.0, published in 1995.

<h2><u>In this chapter we will show some basic HTML examples.</u></h2>

Don't worry if we use tags you have not learned about yet.

HTML Documents<br>
All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration: <!DOCTYPE html>.

The HTML document itself begins with <html> and ends with </html>.

The visible part of the HTML document is between body and body.</pre>

<h3> Declaration</h3>
  <pre>The <!DOCTYPE> declaration represents the document type, and helps browsers to display web pages correctly.
  
It must only appear once, at the top of the page (before any HTML tags).
  
The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is not case sensitive.
  
The <!DOCTYPE> declaration for HTML5 is:!DOCTYPE html</pre>
